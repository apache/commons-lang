Apache Commons Lang, a package of Java utility classes for the
  classes that are in java.lang's hierarchy, or are considered to be so
  standard as to justify existence in java.lang.

  The code is tested using the latest revision of the JDK for supported
  LTS releases: 8, 11, 17 and 21 currently.
  See https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/master/.github/workflows/maven.yml
  
  Please ensure your build environment is up-to-date and kindly report any build issues.

Documentation
-------------

More information can be found on the [Apache Commons Lang homepage](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang).
The [Javadoc](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs) can be browsed.
Questions related to the usage of Apache Commons Lang should be posted to the [user mailing list](https://commons.apache.org/mail-lists.html).

Getting the latest release
--------------------------
You can download source and binaries from our [download page](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi).

Alternatively, you can pull it from the central Maven repositories:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>
  <version>3.18.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Building
--------

Building requires a Java JDK and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
The required Java version can be checked in the `pom.xml` file under the `maven.compiler.source` property (currently Java 8+).

From a command shell, run `mvn` (without arguments) to invoke the default Maven goal, which runs all tests and checks.

Contributing
------------

We accept Pull Requests via GitHub. The [developer mailing list](https://commons.apache.org/mail-lists.html) is the main channel of communication for contributors.
There are some guidelines which will make applying PRs easier for us:
+ No tabs! Please use spaces for indentation.
+ Respect the existing code style for each file.
+ Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports. If you feel the source code should be reformatted create a separate PR for this change.
+ Provide JUnit tests for your changes and make sure your changes don't break any existing tests by running `mvn`.
Before pushing a PR, run `mvn` (without arguments). This executes the default goal, which includes all build checks.
+ To see the code coverage report, regardless of coverage failures, run `mvn clean site -Dcommons.jacoco.haltOnFailure=false -Pjacoco`

If you plan to contribute on a regular basis, please consider filing a [contributor license agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).
You can learn more about contributing via GitHub in our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
