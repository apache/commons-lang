/**
 * {@link StopWatch} provides a convenient API for timings.
 *
 * <p>
 * To start the watch, call {@link #start()} or {@link StopWatch#createStarted()}. At this point you can:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #split()} the watch to get the time whilst the watch continues in the background. {@link #unsplit()} will remove the effect of the split. At this
 * point, these three options are available again.</li>
 * <li>{@link #suspend()} the watch to pause it. {@link #resume()} allows the watch to continue. Any time between the suspend and resume will not be counted in
 * the total. At this point, these three options are available again.</li>
 * <li>{@link #stop()} the watch to complete the timing session.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is intended that the output methods {@link #toString()} and {@link #getTime()} should only be called after stop, split or suspend, however a suitable
 * result will be returned at other points.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTE: As from v2.1, the methods protect against inappropriate calls. Thus you cannot now call stop before start, resume before suspend or unsplit before
 * split.
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #split()}, {@link #suspend()}, or {@link #stop()} cannot be invoked twice</li>
 * <li>{@link #unsplit()} may only be called if the watch has been {@link #split()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #resume()} may only be called if the watch has been {@link #suspend()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #start()} cannot be called twice without calling {@link #reset()}</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is not thread-safe.
