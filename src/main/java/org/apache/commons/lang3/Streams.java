/**
 * Provides utility functions, and classes for working with the
 * {@code java.util.stream} package, or more generally, with Java 8 lambdas. More
 * specifically, it attempts to address the fact that lambdas are supposed
 * not to throw Exceptions, at least not checked Exceptions, AKA instances
 * of {@link Exception}. This enforces the use of constructs like
 * <pre>{@code
 *     Consumer<java.lang.reflect.Method> consumer = m -> {
 *         try {
 *             m.invoke(o, args);
 *         } catch (Throwable t) {
 *             throw Functions.rethrow(t);
 *         }
 *    };
 *    stream.forEach(consumer);
 * }</pre>
 * Using a {@link FailableStream}, this can be rewritten as follows:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     Streams.failable(stream).forEach(m -> m.invoke(o, args));
 * }</pre>
 * Obviously, the second version is much more concise and the spirit of
 * Lambda expressions is met better than in the first version.

     *     final List<O> list;
     *     final Method m;
     *     final Function<O,String> mapper = (o) -> {
     *         try {
     *             return (String) m.invoke(o);

     *             throw Functions.rethrow(t);
     *         }
     *     };
     *     final List<String> strList = list.stream()
     *         .map(mapper).collect(Collectors.toList());
     *  }</pre>
     *  as follows:
     *  <pre>{@code
     *     final List<O> list;
     *     final Method m;
     *     final List<String> strList = Functions.stream(list.stream())
     *         .map((o) -> (String) m.invoke(o)).collect(Collectors.toList());
     *  }</pre>
     *  While the second version may not be <em>quite</em> as
     *  efficient (because it depends on the creation of additional,
     *  intermediate objects, of type FailableStream), it is much more
     *  concise, and readable, and meets the spirit of Lambdas better
     *  than the first version.
