/**
 * A specialized <em>semaphore</em> implementation that provides a number of permits in a given time frame.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is similar to the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore} class provided by the JDK in that it manages a configurable number of permits. Using the
 * {@link #acquire()} method a permit can be requested by a thread. However, there is an additional timing dimension: there is no {@code
 * release()} method for freeing a permit, but all permits are automatically released at the end of a configurable time frame. If a thread calls
 * {@link #acquire()} and the available permits are already exhausted for this time frame, the thread is blocked. When the time frame ends all permits requested
 * so far are restored, and blocking threads are waked up again, so that they can try to acquire a new permit. This basically means that in the specified time
 * frame only the given number of operations is possible.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A use case for this class is to artificially limit the load produced by a process. As an example consider an application that issues database queries on a
 * production system in a background process to gather statistical information. This background processing should not produce so much database load that the
 * functionality and the performance of the production system are impacted. Here a {@link TimedSemaphore} could be installed to guarantee that only a given
 * number of database queries are issued per second.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A thread class for performing database queries could look as follows:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class StatisticsThread extends Thread {
 *     // The semaphore for limiting database load.
 *     private final TimedSemaphore semaphore;
 *     // Create an instance and set the semaphore
 *     public StatisticsThread(TimedSemaphore timedSemaphore) {
 *         semaphore = timedSemaphore;
 *     }
 *     // Gather statistics
 *     public void run() {
 *         try {
 *             while (true) {
 *                 semaphore.acquire();   // limit database load
 *                 performQuery();        // issue a query
 *             }
 *         } catch (InterruptedException) {
 *             // fall through
 *         }
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following code fragment shows how a {@link TimedSemaphore} is created that allows only 10 operations per second and passed to the statistics thread:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * TimedSemaphore sem = new TimedSemaphore(1, TimeUnit.SECOND, 10);
 * StatisticsThread thread = new StatisticsThread(sem);
 * thread.start();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When creating an instance the time period for the semaphore must be specified. {@link TimedSemaphore} uses an executor service with a corresponding period to
 * monitor this interval. The {@code
 * ScheduledExecutorService} to be used for this purpose can be provided at construction time. Alternatively the class creates an internal executor service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Client code that uses {@link TimedSemaphore} has to call the {@link #acquire()} method in each processing step. {@link TimedSemaphore} keeps track of the
 * number of invocations of the {@link #acquire()} method and blocks the calling thread if the counter exceeds the limit specified. When the timer signals the
 * end of the time period the counter is reset and all waiting threads are released. Then another cycle can start.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An alternative to {@code acquire()} is the {@link #tryAcquire()} method. This method checks whether the semaphore is under the specified limit and increases
 * the internal counter if this is the case. The return value is then <strong>true</strong>, and the calling thread can continue with its action. If the
 * semaphore is already at its limit, {@code tryAcquire()} immediately returns <strong>false</strong> without blocking; the calling thread must then abort its
 * action. This usage scenario prevents blocking of threads.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is possible to modify the limit at any time using the {@link #setLimit(int)} method. This is useful if the load produced by an operation has to be adapted
 * dynamically. In the example scenario with the thread collecting statistics it may make sense to specify a low limit during day time while allowing a higher
 * load in the night time. Reducing the limit takes effect immediately by blocking incoming callers. If the limit is increased, waiting threads are not released
 * immediately, but wake up when the timer runs out. Then, in the next period more processing steps can be performed without blocking. By setting the limit to 0
 * the semaphore can be switched off: in this mode the {@link #acquire()} method never blocks, but lets all callers pass directly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the {@link TimedSemaphore} is no more needed its {@link #shutdown()} method should be called. This causes the periodic task that monitors the time
 * interval to be canceled. If the {@link ScheduledExecutorService} has been created by the semaphore at construction time, it is also shut down. resources.
 * After that {@link #acquire()} must not be called any more.
 * </p>
