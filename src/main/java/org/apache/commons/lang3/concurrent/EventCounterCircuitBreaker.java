/**
 * <p>
 * A simple implementation of the <a
 * href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html">Circuit Breaker</a> pattern
 * that counts specific events.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A <em>circuit breaker</em> can be used to protect an application against unreliable
 * services or unexpected load. A newly created {@code EventCounterCircuitBreaker} object is
 * initially in state <em>closed</em> meaning that no problem has been detected. When the
 * application encounters specific events (like errors or service timeouts), it tells the
 * circuit breaker to increment an internal counter. If the number of events reported in a
 * specific time interval exceeds a configurable threshold, the circuit breaker changes
 * into state <em>open</em>. This means that there is a problem with the associated sub
 * system; the application should no longer call it, but give it some time to settle down.
 * The circuit breaker can be configured to switch back to <em>closed</em> state after a
 * certain time frame if the number of events received goes below a threshold.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a {@code EventCounterCircuitBreaker} object is constructed the following parameters
 * can be provided:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A threshold for the number of events that causes a state transition to
 * <em>open</em> state. If more events are received in the configured check interval, the
 * circuit breaker switches to <em>open</em> state.</li>
 * <li>The interval for checks whether the circuit breaker should open. So it is possible
 * to specify something like "The circuit breaker should open if more than 10 errors are
 * encountered in a minute."</li>
 * <li>The same parameters can be specified for automatically closing the circuit breaker
 * again, as in "If the number of requests goes down to 100 per minute, the circuit
 * breaker should close itself again". Depending on the use case, it may make sense to use
 * a slightly lower threshold for closing the circuit breaker than for opening it to avoid
 * continuously flipping when the number of events received is close to the threshold.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This class supports the following typical use cases:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Protecting against load peaks</strong>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Imagine you have a server which can handle a certain number of requests per minute.
 * Suddenly, the number of requests increases significantly - maybe because a connected
 * partner system is going mad or due to a denial of service attack. A
 * {@code EventCounterCircuitBreaker} can be configured to stop the application from
 * processing requests when a sudden peak load is detected and to start request processing
 * again when things calm down. The following code fragment shows a typical example of
 * such a scenario. Here the {@code EventCounterCircuitBreaker} allows up to 1000 requests
 * per minute before it interferes. When the load goes down again to 800 requests per
 * second it switches back to state <em>closed</em>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * EventCounterCircuitBreaker breaker = new EventCounterCircuitBreaker(1000, 1, TimeUnit.MINUTE, 800);
 * ...
 * public void handleRequest(Request request) {
 *     if (breaker.incrementAndCheckState()) {
 *         // actually handle this request
 *     } else {
 *         // do something else, e.g. send an error code
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Deal with an unreliable service</strong>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In this scenario, an application uses an external service which may fail from time to
 * time. If there are too many errors, the service is considered down and should not be
 * called for a while. This can be achieved using the following pattern - in this concrete
 * example we accept up to 5 errors in 2 minutes; if this limit is reached, the service is
 * given a rest time of 10 minutes:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * EventCounterCircuitBreaker breaker = new EventCounterCircuitBreaker(5, 2, TimeUnit.MINUTE, 5, 10, TimeUnit.MINUTE);
 * ...
 * public void handleRequest(Request request) {
 *     if (breaker.checkState()) {
 *         try {
 *             service.doSomething();
 *         } catch (ServiceException ex) {
 *             breaker.incrementAndCheckState();
 *         }
 *     } else {
 *         // return an error code, use an alternative service, etc.
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In addition to automatic state transitions, the state of a circuit breaker can be
 * changed manually using the methods {@link #open()} and {@link #close()}. It is also
 * possible to pass a {@code Consumer} into the constructor that gets called whenever
 * a state transition occurs. This is useful, for instance to directly react on a freshly
 * detected error condition.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <em>Implementation notes:</em>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>This implementation uses non-blocking algorithms to update the internal counter and
 * state. This should be pretty efficient if there is not too much contention.</li>
 * <li>This implementation is not intended to operate as a high-precision timer in very
 * short check intervals. It is deliberately kept simple to avoid complex and
 * time-consuming state checks. It should work well in time intervals from a few seconds
 * up to minutes and longer. If the intervals become too short, there might be race
 * conditions causing spurious state transitions.</li>
 * <li>The handling of check intervals is a bit simplistic. Therefore, there is no
 * guarantee that the circuit breaker is triggered at a specific point in time; there may
 * be some delay (less than a check interval).</li>
 * </ul>
 * @since 3.11
