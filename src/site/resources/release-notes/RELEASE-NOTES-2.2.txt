                        Commons Lang Package
                            Version 2.2
                           Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for the 2.2 version of Apache Jakarta Commons Lang.
Commons Lang is a set of utility functions and reusable components that
should be of use in any Java environment.

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH VERSION 2.1:

- None

ADDITIONAL INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH VERSION 2.0:

- The Nestable interface defines the method indexOfThrowable(Class).
Previously the implementations checked only for a specific Class.
Now they check for subclasses of that Class as well.
For most situations this will be the expected behavior (i.e. it's a bug fix).
If it causes problems, please use the ExceptionUtils.indexOfThrowable(Class) method instead.
Note that the ExceptionUtils method is available in v1.0 and v2.0 of commons-lang and has not been changed.
(An alternative to this is to change the public static matchSubclasses flag on NestableDelegate.
However, we don't recommend that as a long-term solution.)

- The StopWatch class has had much extra validation added.
If your code previously relied on unusual aspects, it may no longer work.

- Starting with version 2.1, Ant version 1.6.x is required to build. Copy 
junit.jar to ANT_HOME/lib. You can get JUnit from https://www.junit.org. See the developer's guide
for more details.

DEPRECATIONS FROM 2.1 to 2.2:

- None

DEPRECATIONS FROM 2.0 to 2.1:

- The enum package has been renamed to enums for JDK 1.5 compliance.
All functionality is identical, just the package has changed.
This package will be removed in v3.0.

- NumberUtils.stringToInt - renamed to toInt

- DateUtils - four constants, MILLIS_IN_* have been deprecated as they were defined
as int not long. The replacements are MILLIS_PER_*.
