                        Commons Lang Package
                            Version 2.4
                           Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for the 2.4 version of Apache Commons Lang.
Commons Lang is a set of utility functions and reusable components that should be of use in any Java environment.

Lang 2.4 no longer attempts to target the Java 1.1 environment and now targets Java 1.2. While previous versions 
were built for 1.1, some parts were using methods that were only available in 1.2, and the Enum class had 
become dependent on Java 1.3. 

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH VERSION 2.3:

- None

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH VERSION 2.2:

- Calling stop on a suspended StopWatch will no longer change the underlying time. 
  It's very unlikely anyone was relying on that bug as a feature.

ADDITIONAL INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES WITH VERSION 2.0:

- The Nestable interface defines the method indexOfThrowable(Class).
Previously the implementations checked only for a specific Class.
Now they check for subclasses of that Class as well.
For most situations this will be the expected behavior (i.e. it's a bug fix).
If it causes problems, please use the ExceptionUtils.indexOfThrowable(Class) method instead.
Note that the ExceptionUtils method is available in v1.0 and v2.0 of commons-lang and has not been changed.
(An alternative to this is to change the public static matchSubclasses flag on NestableDelegate.
However, we don't recommend that as a long-term solution.)

- The StopWatch class has had much extra validation added.
If your code previously relied on unusual aspects, it may no longer work.

- Starting with version 2.1, Ant version 1.6.x is required to build. Copy 
junit.jar to ANT_HOME/lib. You can get JUnit from https://www.junit.org. See the developer's guide
for more details.

DEPRECATIONS FROM 2.3 to 2.4:

- ObjectUtils.appendIdentityToString(StringBuffer, Object) - has very odd semantics, use 
  ObjectUtils.identityToString(StringBuffer, Object) instead.

- public static java.util.Date add(java.util.Date, int, int) - it is not intended for this 
  method to be public. Please let us know if you use this. 

DEPRECATIONS FROM 2.2 to 2.3:

- None

DEPRECATIONS FROM 2.1 to 2.2:

- None

DEPRECATIONS FROM 2.0 to 2.1:

- The enum package has been renamed to enums for JDK 1.5 compliance.
All functionality is identical, just the package has changed.
This package will be removed in v3.0.

- NumberUtils.stringToInt - renamed to toInt

- DateUtils - four constants, MILLIS_IN_* have been deprecated as they were defined
as int not long. The replacements are MILLIS_PER_*.
