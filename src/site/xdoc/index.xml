<p>
The standard Java libraries fail to provide enough methods for
manipulation of its core classes. The <em>Lang</em> Component provides
these extra methods. 
</p>

<p>
The <em>Lang</em> Component provides a host of helper utilities for the java.lang API, notably 
String manipulation methods, basic numerical methods, object reflection, creation and serialization, 
and System properties. Additionally it contains an inheritable enum type, an exception structure that 
supports multiple types of nested-Exceptions, basic enhancements to java.util.Date and a series of utilities dedicated to help with 
building methods, such as hashCode, toString and equals.
