<section name="Commons Lang">

<p>
The standard Java libraries fail to provide enough methods for
manipulation of its core classes. Apache Commons Lang provides
these extra methods.
</p>

<p>
Apache Commons Lang provides a host of helper utilities for the java.lang API, notably
String manipulation methods, basic numerical methods, object reflection, concurrency, creation and serialization
and System properties. Additionally it contains basic enhancements to java.util.Date and a series of utilities dedicated to help with
building methods, such as hashCode, toString and equals.
</p>
<p>
Note that Commons Lang 3.0 (and subsequent versions) use a different package (<em>org.apache.commons.lang3</em>) than the previous versions (<em>org.apache.commons.lang</em>), 
allowing Commons Lang 3 to be used at the same time as Commons Lang 2.
